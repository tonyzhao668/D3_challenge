## My Task Done!


You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.


### Bonus: Done to Impress the Boss

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

I have included more demographics and more risk factors. 3 factors have been deployed for each axis.
So users can check my charts by any x, y combination as their like.


#### 2. Incorporate d3-tooltip effect added
 
Done!
